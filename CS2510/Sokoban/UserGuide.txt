SOKOBAN HOW TO PLAY

OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: as the player, clear levels by pushing each trophy on top of the same 
colored target, you will win once you place each corresponding trophy to the corresponding target!

-----------------------------------------------

Item Mechanics
- walls : the player cannot pass through them, and they do not move
- boxes : the player cannot pass through them, but they can be moved by the player if the box 
  is not adjacent to another object
- targets (floor) : the player and other movable items can pass through them, they are fixed on
   the ground 
    - red, yellow, blue, green
- trophies : the player cannot pass through them, but they can be moved by the player if 
  the trophy is not adjacent to another object
    - red, yellow, blue, green
- holes : the player cannot pass though them, and they do not move. if the player or an item moves 
  onto one, the player will disappear and the game will end
  or the item will disappear and the hole will turn into a blank space, so it will be 
  safe for the player to move
- ice : of a player steps onto ice, they will slide until they collide with an immovable item or
	land on a non-ice tile; if they crash into a movable item, the movable item starts sliding too

-----------------------------------------------

Controls
- w (or up arrow key): player moves up
- a, (or left arrow key) : player moves left
- s, (or down arrow key) : player moves down
- d, (or right arrow key) : player moves right
- u : most recent step is undone

Gameplay:
- How to Win: End the game with a win by placing each trophy on the corresponding target
- How to Lose: End the game with a lose by losing the player into a black hole
- Keeping Score: each time you press a key the score is increased by 1; undoing a move will
	increase the score, so undoing a bad move doesn't not rewind the score; lower scores are better
- What to do:
	-> player can move up, down, left, right
	-> player can move movable objects (boxes and trophies) as the player moves in the 
	   corresponding direction
	-> player cannot move movable objects if said objects are adjacent to other objects, 
	   move-able or immovable
	-> player can push objects into black holes to fill them and be able to walk over to them 
	-> player can fall into holes to end games
	-> player cannot move past walls or onto walls
	-> player can slide on ice
